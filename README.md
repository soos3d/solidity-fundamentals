# solidity-fundamentals
Here you will find .sol files containing notes and explanations about the basics of the solidity smart contracts language. These are meant to be used to have examples about the syntax and very brief explanations. I recommend to use the Remix IDE to test them.

My goal here is to have clear and basic examples to help teach the foundations of the solidity language, while learning it I have noticed that evry tutorial or course skims very quicly over these topics and I want to help providing the basics in a more clear format.

I will add new files regularly as they are ready.

List of files:

- solidity_basics_varibles.sol --> In this file you will find a collection of the varuables available in solidit, with some brief explanation as comments.
