# solidity-fundamentals
Here you will find .sol files containing notes and explanations about the basics of the solidity smart contracts language. These are meant to be used to have examples about the syntax and very brief explanations. I recommend to use the Remix IDE to test them. https://remix.ethereum.org/

My goal here is to give clear and basic examples to help teach the foundations of the solidity language, while learning it I have noticed that every tutorial or course skims very quicly over these topics and I want to help providing the basics in a more clear format.

I will add new files regularly as they are ready.

List of files:

- solidity_basics_varibles.sol --> In this file you will find a collection of the variables available in solidity, with some brief explanation as comments.
- solidity_basics_arrays.sol   --> In this file you will find examples of arrays in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
- solidity_basics_mappings.sol --> In this file you will find examples of mappings in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
- solidity_basics_loops.sol    --> In this file you will find examples of loops and conditionals in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
- solidity_basics_enum.sol     --> In this file you will find examples of enum in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
